I have only worked with Flutter.. 

Flutter is a frame work that provides native app support for both android and ios , 
like you can build native applications for android and ios using flutter...
it is developed by google.. Flutter uses its own rendering engine called Skia...The language used by Flutter is called Dart.. 

Cross-platform frameworks usually attempt to smooth out the inconsistencies of each platform representation by creating an abstraction layer over the underlying native iOS and Android UI libraries.... But Flutter bypasses the system’s UI widget libraries in favor of its own widget set and thus minimizes the abstractions. Flutter’s visuals are painted by the Dart code. It gets compiled into the native code, which utilizes Skia for rendering. As part of the engine, Flutter also embeds its own copy of Skia..."
